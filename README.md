# Unity3D-Data-Classes
Two classes that provides information about the global variables of the game.

ConfigurationData class contains all the data values, it contains a function where you can read a CSV file, and use those values. An advantage of this feature is that you can use the CSV file to "patch" your game without the need of touching your code.

ConfigurationUtils class is a static class that provides access to ConfigurationData values.
